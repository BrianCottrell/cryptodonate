## Blockcharity

A netflix-style donation app for crypto focused on raising money for crisis recovery and charitable organizations (such as those for COVID-19). Leverages bitcoin lightning network to send payments at minimal cost to various organizations, enabling microtransactions.

### Inspiration

With no shortage of great causes available for charitable donations, we wanted to create a platform to enable us to quickly choose and split our donations among several organizations.

### What it does

Blockcharity is a video browsing application for charitable organizations. Users can donate directly to charities featured on the website using bitcoin either on chain or over the lightning network. Selected charities will receive the donation either on chain or over the lightning network depending on whether or not they have a lightning wallet available. This give charities the opportunity to transition to the lightning network at any time and enjoy the benefits. The lightning network provides numerous benefits:

Charities from around the world to receive large amounts of small donations with minimal costs for transaction fees and currency conversion.
Charities can continue to accept payments without fees as long as they remain in the lightning channel
When a desired charity is discovered, use an existing lightning enabled wallet to instantly donate to that charity (by Bitcoin address).
Shorter settlement times also mean the charity has more immediate access to funds.
